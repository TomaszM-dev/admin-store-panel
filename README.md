With Antonio's help from 'Code with Antonio' I made a tool for SpeedRent: admin dashboard. You can add categories, products, types, brands, pick horsepower for vehicles. It's super simple to add new stuff, and see your added products on the SpeedRent store. They pop up because they are fetched from the dashboard's API. Antonio's videos were my guide; without them, I couldn't have done it. Thanks
